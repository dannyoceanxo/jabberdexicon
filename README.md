# The Jabberdexicon

The Jabberdexicon is an app built during our cohort at the Iron Yard as part of a week-long assignment.  We all collaborated to build a glossary of terms that people such as ourselves would find useful during their time learning to be developers.  These ranged from simple terms like "user interface" to oddly specific terms like "banapple," which we used as a word that could mean anything, just a placeholder of sorts.  Hopefully this is helpful to anyone else starting out and we encourage more contributions.
